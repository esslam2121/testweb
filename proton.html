React useState Hook
useState does exactly what it says—it allows us to use stateful values in function components.

useState is used instead of a simple variable because when state is updated, our component re-renders, usually to display that updated value.

Like all hooks, we call useState at the top of our component and can pass it an initial value to put on its state variable.

We use array destructuring on the value returned from useState to access (1) the stored state and (2) a function to update that state.

import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [stateValue, setStateValue] = useState(initialValue);
}
A basic example of using useState is to increment a counter.

We can see the current count from the count variable and can increment the state by passing count + 1 to the setCount function.

import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function updateCount() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return <button onClick={updateCount}>Count is: {count}</button>;
}
React useEffect Hook
If we want to interact with the “outside world”, such as using an API, we use the useEffect hook.

useEffect is used to perform a side effect, which means to perform an operation that exists outside of our app that doesn’t have a predictable result.

The basic syntax of useEffect requires a function as a first argument and an array as the second argument.

import { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
   useEffect(() => {
     // perform side effect here
   }, []);
}
If we want to fetch data, we would use useEffect, such as in fetching and displaying a list of posts:

import { useEffect } from 'react';

function PostList() {
	 const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

   useEffect(() => {
	   fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(posts => setPosts(posts));
   }, []);

   return posts.map(post => <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
}
If we need to use a value that comes from outside the effect function, it must be included in the dependencies array.

If that value changes, the effect function will be re-executed.

For example, here is a bit of code that adds or removes the class “overflow-hidden” to the body element whenever the mobile menu is opened or closed.

function Mobile({ open }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const body = document.querySelector("#__next");

    if (open) {
      body.classList.add("overflow-hidden");
    } else {
      body.classList.remove("overflow-hidden");
    }
  }, [open]);
 
  // ...
}
React useRef
useRef allows us to get direct access to a JSX element.

To use useRef, call it, get the returned value, and put it on the ref prop for a given React element.

Refs do not have a built-in prop on components, only React elements.
Here is the basic syntax for useRef:

import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const ref = useRef();

  return <div ref={ref} />
}
Once a ref is attached to a given element, we can use the value stored on ref.current to access the element itself.

For example, if we wanted to write some code that focuses a search input when the users use the key combination Control + K.

import { useWindowEvent } from "@mantine/hooks";
import { useRef } from "react";

function Header() {
	const inputRef = useRef();

  useWindowEvent("keydown", (event) => {
    if (event.code === "KeyK" && event.ctrlKey) {
      event.preventDefault();
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  });
  
  return <input ref={inputRef} />
}
